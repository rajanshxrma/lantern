"""Real (no-mock) tests for capture.py -- both screen and camera.

Camera capture needs the Camera permission already granted to whatever
terminal/process runs this suite (macOS's one-time prompt, granted once via
System Settings > Privacy & Security > Camera, sticks per-app after that).
Skips itself if that permission hasn't been granted yet rather than hanging
on a prompt nothing here can click through."""
