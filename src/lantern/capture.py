"""Image capture sources for lantern -- screen and camera.

Screen capture shells out to /usr/sbin/screencapture rather than driving
ScreenCaptureKit directly. Both are stable, non-beta APIs, but screencapture
is a single well-tested system binary Apple has shipped and maintained for
two decades, with permission handling (Screen Recording, prompted once by
the OS) already solved -- the same "shell out to a stable OS tool instead of
re-implementing its permission/plumbing story" choice private-agent already
makes for AppleScript (see tools/_applescript.py there). Reaching for
ScreenCaptureKit's own async, delegate-based capture API would mean
re-solving problems screencapture has already solved, for no behavioral
difference lantern needs.

Camera capture does use AVFoundation directly (via PyObjC) -- there's no
simple CLI equivalent, and a single still frame from the default camera is
a small, well-bounded piece of that API surface.
