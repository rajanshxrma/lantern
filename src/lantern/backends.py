"""Image-description backends for lantern.

Two backends, chosen automatically at runtime, not configured by hand:

- "native": Apple's on-device Foundation Model given the image directly, via
  FoundationModels.Attachment<ImageAttachmentContent> (macOS 27 beta only --
  verified directly against the beta SDK's real .swiftinterface, not assumed
  from the WWDC26 preview description; see native/Sources/.../main.swift).
  This is a pure-Swift API surface (generics, protocols) that PyObjC cannot
  bridge at all -- verified directly too: `import FoundationModels` fails
  under PyObjC even with the beta installed. So NativeImageBackend shells
  out to a small compiled Swift helper (native/), the same pattern already
  used for /usr/sbin/screencapture in capture.py, rather than a PyObjC call.
- "vision": Apple's Vision framework (stable, mature, shipped for years) for
  OCR (VNRecognizeTextRequest) and scene/object classification
  (VNClassifyImageRequest), with the extracted text/labels handed to the
  same on-device Foundation Model for narration -- the model never sees
  pixels in this path, only Vision's structured output. This is the backend
  every clone of this repo actually gets, beta or not.

get_backend() always tries native first and falls back to vision -- never
raises for "no native backend", since not having the beta is the normal
case, not an error.

A third real finding, beyond "beta or not installed": even with the beta SDK
installed and the helper compiled successfully against it, the *compiled*
binary can still fail at *runtime* with a dyld "Symbol not found" error if
the installed OS beta build doesn't exactly match the Xcode-beta build it
was compiled against (observed directly: Xcode-beta 27A5209h's SDK declared
`Attachment.init(imageURL:orientation:)`, but the installed OS beta's actual
`/System/Library/Frameworks/FoundationModels.framework` didn't yet export
that symbol at runtime -- a real Xcode-beta/OS-beta version skew, not a bug
in this code). `_probe_native()` therefore does a real subprocess smoke-test
of the compiled binary, not just a file-existence check -- a dyld symbol
failure exits 134 immediately (before main() runs) regardless of arguments,
which is a fast, reliable, distinguishable signal from a clean "no such
image" failure (exit 2) that proves the binary actually loaded and ran.

The skew played out exactly as this design expected: rebuilding the helper
against the matching Xcode 27 beta 3 SDK (27A5218g, on the macOS 27 beta 3
OS) fixed the symbol binding and the probe promoted this machine to native
automatically -- zero changes anywhere in this file.
